                                begin to build my network.
                                I can demonstrate my understanding that everything that I do online leaves a footprint that
                                cannot be undone by using privacy settings and by being thoughtful about the things I post or
                                write (e.g. text messages, snapchats, comments, videoes, pictures, etc.). 
                                I can think about how what I write and post will make others feel and I make sure I don't write
                                or post anything I wouldn't want my parent, teacher, prospective employer, and/or college
                                admissions counselor to see.
                                I can check my online profiles regularly to see what comments have been posted and I can block
                                or unfriend people who are posting comments that are inappropriate.
                                I can regularly use a search engine (e.g. Google, Bing, etc.) to look for online records of
                                myself to see what is online about me. I can evaluate whether or not digital me is an accurate
                                representation of real-life me.
